## FAQ

### Who are you?

We are two rats shitposting. Encoder Rat Decoder Rat (EüêÄDüêÄ) is creative technologists [Dylan Box](https://dylanbox.com/) (they/them) and [M Kuznetsov](https://mariakuz.github.io/) (they/them), who first met through queer leftbook. Their vision is to explore the rat techno future (a lens for radical digital explorations). Individually, M‚Äôs previous work has focused on designing and questioning alternative futures, such as their newsletter, The Finkedin Dispatch, and a zine on exploring drag influences for adversarial attacks on facial recognition. Dylan‚Äôs work has focused on building and supporting community-driven creative spaces in Detroit. They have worked developing branding and curriculum for the Mt. Elliott Makerspace and the Hype Teen Center, and the opening of two art galleries and studios, The Untitled Bottega and Riopelle Collective.


### What does ERDR mean?

You know, one rat encodes, the other decodes. Rat neural interfaces strike a note in us all.
