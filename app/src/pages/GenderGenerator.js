    <h1 id="gender-generator">Gender Generator</h1>
    <p>Our debut project is <a href="https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu/works/gender-generator/view.html">Gender Generator</a>, commissioned by MIT CAST as part of their <a href="https://generative-unfoldings.mit.edu/">Generative Unfoldings exhibition</a> in conjunction with the 2021 CAST Symposium, “Unfolding Intelligence.”</p>
    <h2 id="about-the-piece">About the piece</h2>
    <p>The ways programmers organize, collect, and sort gender data and subsequent user interfaces reflect their society’s assumptions: male or female, singular, static. In datasets, gender is frequently assigned post-collection, assumed by visual cues rooted in socialization. When input by a user, any interface fails to capture the true magnitude of a gender.</p>
    <p>We now have the computational power to traverse every gender. We must ask: we do want to be categorized this way? After all, queerness rebukes labels; data science inherently classifies through arbitrary boundaries.</p>
    <p>Gender Generator is a novel interface for gender selection, drawing from the potential of computational gender. By trawling categories and visualizing their overlaps, the algorithm presents an increasing amount of binary choices, inviting the viewer to interpret the resulting data. The morphing shapes encourage us to seek joy in uncertainty; divine our nebulous identities in the past, present, and future; rebuke schemas.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, we see this project as one interface in the face of a new design future, with the goal of queering the entire internet. Want to work with us?</p>
