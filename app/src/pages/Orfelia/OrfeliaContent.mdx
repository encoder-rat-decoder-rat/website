# A Night at The Orfelia

Step off the sidewalk and enter through the curtain into the fog-machine-filled future at the Orfelia. Tonight, we corporealize queer yearning. Grab an embroidered hanky to flag kinks not-yet-possible and pocket some naloxone just in case at the coat check. Run your hands along the wall-mounted algae bioreactor and fondle a genetically engineered slug designed for DIY hormone treatment. The stage and dancefloors beckon: catch a performance of queer transmasculine erotics and athleticism with the Transfag Olympics or wrestle in the dirt of The Pit, an ecosexual wormplay space. Sip drinks made with food waste while eyeing an ad for a transition doula.

A club night in 2053 that ecstatically envisions the sloppy, utopian, and queer future.
