## The Orfelia Presents MESSSY – A Night of Queer Nightlife History and Futures in Detroit

Detroit, MI – Queer Futures Collective, the team behind the Orfelia project, is excited to announce MESSSY, an evening of dancing, art and reflection on the past and future of queer nightlife in Detroit. This event is in partnership with Detroit Sound Conservancy and Arts & Scraps and set to take place in Detroit on November 18th.

As the Orfelia project continues to gain momentum in advance of a larger spring event, we are eager to raise awareness and foster support for this innovative endeavor. MESSSY serves as a preview event that will showcase in-progress work, our inspirations, and introduce new people to the world of the Orfelia.

**Event Highlights**

MESSSY is an art show featuring artifacts from the future (artist imaginations of the future of queer nightlife). Attendees will have the opportunity to dance and socialize, thanks to electrifying DJ sets. The feature work will highlight historical clubs, depictions of the future and reflection on what their future of nightlife might look like, connecting the past and the future.

The Queer Futures Collective artists will be present to share their work and opportunities for involvement. For more information about MESSSY and the Orfelia project, follow us on Instagram at [@theorfelia](https://www.instagram.com/theorfelia/) or visit us at https://rat.computer/orfelia.
