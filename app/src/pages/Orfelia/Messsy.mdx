<h2>November 18th</h2>

In November, we hosted MESSSY, a preview our event series: a Night at the Orfelia. We invited artists to create a poster or preview of their work and share what they’re imagining 2053 will hold. MESSSY was an art show, a dance floor, and a gloopyhole into the future of queer nightlife (and the world around it).

We had low expectations for this event that we were funding out of pocket. However, y'all showed up! All of those hours running ourselves ragged were worth it to see how people's eyes lit up in the space. We welcomed 500 attendees and received at least 150 reflections on preferred futures. Resident Advisor selected us as an RA Pick event, Pride Source listed us as "5 Queer Things You Can Do Right Now-ish," and over 400k people watched our Twink Mines reel on Instagram. Those numbers pale next to the comments and praise you made sure to tell us in person and online.

Being in community with you is a blessing. We're very grateful to everyone who left us feedback on where we can grow. Thank you so much to all of the volunteers who helped us build out the set, and to everyone who came to envision our preferred futures.

MESSSY is an art show featuring artifacts from the future (artist imaginations of the future of queer nightlife). Attendees will have the opportunity to dance and socialize, thanks to electrifying DJ sets. The feature work will highlight historical clubs, depictions of the future and reflection on what their future of nightlife might look like, connecting the past and the future.
