Scientists quickly began to realize the benefits of these fungus’s greatly malleable genetic pool and began selectively breeding fungi which all had a trait that enables them to break down and convert plastic to energy. In this process, scientists began to uncover another closely related trait: The output of this extra energy to create sound and light. This began one of the most popular interdisciplinary collaborations between art/science in the 2040’s, with artists, scientists and hobbyists selectively breeding musical funguses, funded  by carbon offset/plastic reduction initiatives. This artistic and scientific breakthrough represented a major cultural and ideological shift as well as a new interest in mycology as a DIY hobby.</p><p>Nick Szydlo is an interdimensional tinkerer, junk craftsman and transdisciplinary artist.</p><p>Sean is a Detroit-based electronic producer and synth player.
